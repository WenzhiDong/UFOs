Dana is a data jornalist. She is given an opportunity to write about her hometown, McMinnville Oregon, which is famous for its sightings of UFOs and even has an annual gathering of UFO fans.
So, she chooses the topic of UFOs.
In this project, css, js, html files are used together.

Fnally, A webpage is created to show the UFO sighting events and provides the functionality of filtering.

## Summary
### Drawback
The filter is case sensitive and cannot apply partially search. For example, if we search "Triangle" or "tri", it does not give any result.

### Possible Further improvement
 - providing hyperlink for each event, which includes more details and some pictures
 - showing the total amount of sighting events
